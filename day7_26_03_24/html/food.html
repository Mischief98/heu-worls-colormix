            <p>Tandoori cookery started five thousand years ago from the Harappan civilisations in Indus valley of ancient India. Besides the Indian subcontinent, it was discovered that people in West and Central Asia use a tandoor. This clay oven was also found in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations.</p>
            <p>To start, let's define tandoori. This term refers to a specific style of cooking in which food has been grilled inside a tandoor (clay oven). If you've never come across a tandoor oven before, imagine a hollow drum standing upright with a small fire heating from the bottom.</p>
